Pneumonia Detection System

Overview:
This project involves the development of a website and backend system to detect pneumonia using chest X-rays. 
The solution leverages a pre-trained deep learning model and provides a chatbot-based interface for guidance 
on symptoms, diagnosis, and possible treatment suggestions. It is designed to be user-friendly for both doctors and patients.

Key Features:
1. **Pneumonia Detection**:
   - The system uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on chest X-ray images to classify whether a patient has pneumonia.
   - The model accepts a chest X-ray image as input and predicts the likelihood of pneumonia.

2. **Web Interface**:
   - Built using HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.
   - Provides an easy-to-use interface for uploading X-rays and viewing predictions.
   - Includes a chatbot feature to answer queries related to pneumonia symptoms and general care.

3. **Backend**:
   - Developed using Python (with Flask or FastAPI) to handle model inference.
   - Integrated with MongoDB to store patient data, model predictions, and user interactions.
   - Provides an API for communication between the web interface and the model.

4. **Purpose**:
   - To assist doctors in making quick and accurate diagnoses of pneumonia.
   - To provide patients with better understanding and preliminary insights about their condition.
   - To reduce diagnostic time and improve accessibility to expert-level predictions.

Development Process:
1. **Model Development**:
   - The pre-trained model (stored as pneumonia_classifier.h5) is a CNN trained on labeled chest X-ray datasets.
   - It was fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy in detecting pneumonia versus normal X-rays.

2. **Backend Integration**:
   - The model is loaded using TensorFlow and exposed as an API endpoint.
   - Uploaded X-ray images are preprocessed and passed through the model for inference.

3. **Web Design**:
   - Designed an intuitive UI for doctors and patients to upload X-rays and receive predictions.
   - Integrated a chatbot for user interaction, offering advice and answering common questions.

4. **Deployment**:
   - The system is deployed on a server with the backend connected to MongoDB for data storage.

Impact:
- This system empowers healthcare providers by automating the initial screening process for pneumonia.
- It bridges the gap between patients and healthcare resources by providing accessible, automated diagnostic insights.
- By speeding up diagnosis, it aids in timely treatment, which is crucial for severe cases.

Conclusion:
The Pneumonia Detection System is a step toward integrating AI into healthcare, improving diagnostic capabilities, and fostering better patient-doctor interactions. Its implementation ensures more efficient and accurate healthcare services.
